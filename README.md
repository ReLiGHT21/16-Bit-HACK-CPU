The 16-bit HACK CPU is a learning project that I decided to build to understand the concepts of digital electronics and how that translates to real world applications.
I wanted to build a computer because that is what came to my mind as soon as I thought about something useful, that will also give me a lot of work experience. 

Even though any sort of VLSI porject includes RTL Design, verification, layout and multiple other procedures, this project focuses more on the fundanmentals and RTL design. 

However, instead of widely used language Verilog, this project uses a proprietary language built by the instructors of the course which I followed.
This eases out my burden of verifying a code written in different language. However, the code is close enough to verilog that I can translate it on a later stage. 

I am very proud of this project as it is my first entry into the VLSI Domain, and I got to learn a lot!
